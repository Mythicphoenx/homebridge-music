## Homebridge plugin for iTunes with Airplay speakers
Copyright Â© 2016-2020 Erik Baauw. All rights reserved.

This [homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) plugin exposes controls to Apple's [HomeKit](http://www.apple.com/ios/home/) for a music player, like iTunes/Music or EyeTV, running on macOS.  It provides the following features:
- HomeKit support for controlling iTunes (Music as of macOS 10.15 Catalina) or [EyeTV](https://www.geniatech.eu/):
  - On/Off control;
  - Volume control;
  - Previous/Next track/channel;
  - View current track/channel;
- HomeKit support for controlling AirPlay speakers connected to iTunes/Music on macOS:
  - On/Off control;
  - Volume control;
- HomeKit control for [Airfoil](https://rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/)-connected speakers:
  - On/Off control;
  - Volume control;
- Provides an AppleScript framework to support other players.

Note: this is my old, never before published, plugin from 2016 that I used to control my music, before moving to Sonos and [homebridge-zp](https://github.com/ebaauw/homebridge-zp).

### Prerequisites
You need a macOS system to run homebridge-music.  AppleScript is used to communicate with iTunes/Music, EyeTV, or another music player, and that only runs on macOS.

To interact with HomeKit, you need Siri or a HomeKit app on an iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, iPod Touch, or Apple TV (4th generation or later).  I recommend to use the latest released versions of iOS, watchOS, and tvOS.  
Please note that Siri and even Apple's [Home](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204893) app still provide only limited HomeKit support.  To use the full features of homebridge-music, you might want to check out some other HomeKit apps, like Elgato's [Eve](https://www.elgato.com/en/eve/eve-app) app (free) or Matthias Hochgatterer's [Home](http://selfcoded.com/home/) app (paid).  
For HomeKit automation, you need to setup an Apple TV (4th generation or later) or iPad as [Home Hub](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207057).


### Player and Speakers
The homebridge-music plugin creates an accessory *Music* for the player.  By default, this accessory contains a single `Switch` service, with the same name as the accessory.  In addition to the standard `Power State` characteristic for play/pause control, additional characteristics are provided for `Volume`, `Change Track`, and `Current Track` (read-only).  Note that `Current Track` and `Change Group` are custom characteristics.  They might not be supported by all HomeKit apps, see [**Caveats**](#caveats).  

For each AirPlay or Airfoil speaker, homebridge-music creates an additional accessory, named after the speaker.  By default, these accessory contain a single `Switch` service, with the same name as the accessory.  In addition to the standard `Power State` characteristic for play/pause control, an additional characteristic is provided for `Volume`.

Note that neither Siri nor the Apple's Home app support `Volume`, even thought this is a standard HomeKit characteristic.  Because of this, the type of the service, as well as the type of characteristic used for volume can be changed from `config.json`, see [**Configuration**](#configuration) and [homebridge-zp issue #10](https://github.com/ebaauw/homebridge-zp/issues/10).

### Installation
The homebridge-music plugin obviously needs homebridge, which, in turn needs Node.js.  I've followed these steps to set it up on my macOS server:

- Install the latest v10 LTS version of Node.js.  On macOS, download the [10.x.x LTS](https://nodejs.org) installer.  This includes the `npm` package manager;
- Make sure `/usr/local/bin` is in your `$PATH`, as `node`, `npm`, and, later, `homebridge` install there;
- You might want to update `npm` through `sudo npm -g update npm@latest`;
- Install homebridge through `sudo npm -g install homebridge`.  Follow the instructions on [GitHub](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge#installation) to create a `config.json` in `~/.homebridge`, as described;
- Install the homebridge-music plugin through `sudo npm -g install homebridge-music`;
- Edit `~/.homebridge/config.json` and add the Music platform provided by homebridge-music, see [**Configuration**](#configuration).

Once homebridge is up and running with the homebridge-music plugin, you might want to daemonise it and start it automatically on login or system boot.  See the [homebridge Wiki](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge/wiki) for more info how to do that on MacOS.

### Configuration
In homebridge's `config.json` you need to specify a platform for homebridge-music:
```json
  "platforms": [
    {
      "platform": "Music"
    }
  ]
```
The following optional parameters can be added to modify homebridge-music's behaviour:

Key | Default | Description
--- | ------- | -----------
`service` | `"switch"` | Defines what type of service and volume characteristic homebridge-music uses.  Possible values are: `"switch"` for `Switch` and `Volume`; `"speaker"` for `Speaker` and `Volume`; `"light"` for `LightBulb` and `Brightness`; and `"fan"` for `Fan` and `Rotation Speed`.  Selecting `"light"` or `"fan"` enables changing the volume from Siri and from Apple's Home app.  Selecting `"speaker"` is not supported by the Apple's Home app.
`brightness` | `false` | Flag whether to expose volume as `Brightness` in combination with `Switch` or `Speaker`.  Setting this flag enables volume control from Siri.
`script` | `"iTunes"` | Name of the AppleScript library to interact with the player and speakers, see [**AppleScript**](#applescript).
`speakername` | `".*"` _(any)_ | Regular expression to be used as filter for speaker names.
`track` | `""` _(none)_ | Name of the track for the player to start.
`resetTrack` | `false` | Reset current track to default track on stop.
`heartrate` | 5 |	Heartbeat interval in seconds.  Player and speaker states are refreshed every heartrate seconds.

### AppleScript
homebridge-music interacts with the music player and speakers is through AppleScript.  Each player/speaker combination has an associated AppleScript file in `/usr/local/lib/node_modules/homebridge-music/scripts`.

homebridge-music ships with the following scripts:

Script          | Player | Speakers | macOS
--------------- | -------| -------- | -----------
`iTunes`        | iTunes | iTunes AirPlay speakers | < 10.15 Catalina
`Music`         | Music  | Music AirPlay speakers | >= 10.15 Catalina
`Airfoil`       | iTunes | [Airfoil](https://www.rogueamoeba.com/airfoil) | < 10.15 Catalina
`Music-Airfoil` | Music  | [Airfoil](https://www.rogueamoeba.com/airfoil) | >= 10.15 Catalina
`EyeTV`         | [EyeTV v3](https://www.geniatech.eu/product/eyetv-3/)* | [Airfoil](https://www.rogueamoeba.com/airfoil) | < 10.15 Catalina
_n/a_           | [EyeTV v4](https://www.geniatech.eu/product/eyetv-4/)* | [Airfoil](https://www.rogueamoeba.com/airfoil) | n/a

\*) EyeTV v3 is a 32-bit application, which are no longer supported on macOS 10.15 Catalina.<br>
\*) EyeTV v4 is a 64-bit application and runs on Catalina,
but it (currently?) lacks proper AppleScript support,
see issue [#14](https://github.com/ebaauw/homebridge-music/issues/14).

Each script provides the following functions to homebridge-music:

Function | Schema | Description
--- | ------- | -----------
`getState(initial)` | `GetState` | Gets player and speaker states.
`setPlayerOn(on, track)` | `SetOn` |	Switches Player On/Off.
`changeTrack(next)` | `SetOn` | Sets next/previous track.
`setPlayerVolume(vol)` | `SetVolume` | Sets Player Volume.
`setSpeakerOn(id, on)` | `SetOn` | Switches Speaker On/Off.
`setSpeakerVolume(id, vol)` | `SetVolume` | Sets Speaker Volume.

These functions return a JSON string that conforms to the corresponding schema in `/usr/local/lib/node_modules/homebridge-music/lib`.

You can add your own script to support your favourite music player.  To verify whether your script returns valid responses, you might want to use [JSON Schema Lint](http://jsonschemalint.com/).

### Caveats
The homebridge-music plugin is a hobby project of mine, provided as-is, with no warranty whatsoever.  I had been running it successfully at my home for years, but your mileage might vary.  Please report any issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/ebaauw/homebridge-music/issues).

Homebridge is a great platform, but not really intended for consumers, as it requires command-line interaction.

HomeKit is still relatively new, and Apple's [Home](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204893) app provides only limited support.  You might want to check out some other HomeKit apps, like Elgato's [Eve](https://www.elgato.com/en/eve/eve-app) (free), Matthias Hochgatterer's [Home](http://selfcoded.com/home/) (paid), or, if you use `Xcode`, Apple's [HMCatalog](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/HomeKitCatalog/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015048-Intro-DontLinkElementID_2) example app.

The HomeKit terminology needs some getting used to.  An _accessory_ more or less corresponds to a physical device, accessible from your iOS device over WiFi or Bluetooth.  A _bridge_ (like homebridge) provides access to multiple bridged accessories.  An accessory might provide multiple _services_.  Each service corresponds to a virtual device (like a lightbulb, switch, motion sensor, ...).  There is also an accessory information service.  Siri interacts with services, not with accessories.  A service contains one or more _characteristics_.  A characteristic is like a service attribute, which might be read or written by HomeKit apps.  You might want to checkout Apple's [HomeKit Accessory Simulator](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/HomeKitDeveloperGuide/TestingYourHomeKitApp/TestingYourHomeKitApp.html), which is distributed as an additional tool for `Xcode`.
